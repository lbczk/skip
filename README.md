# Skip lists

Felt a bit nostalgic of the 90's before christmas, so I decided to implement a good old data structure in Java.  
As D. Knuth once put it [1], Skip lists are to simple linked list what the Pan-American highway is to an old dirt path.
The "express lanes" allow for much more efficient search, insertion and deletion (not implemented in this project yet).
The indexable version presented here [2] also supports a get(int i) method, and is easier to print.
